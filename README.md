# Language-Translation

These files are my solutions for the fourth project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation course. The objective was to generate efficient machine translation from French to English (with a limited vocabulary) using the latest Sequence to Sequence recurrent neural network architecture.

Python and Tensorflow were used to program and model the network. The code is included in dlnd_language_translation.ipynb.
